                  TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION 📊🚢
Bar Plot for Survival Count 📈✨

This plot shows the count of passengers who survived versus those who did not. Each bar represents the survival status, making it easy to compare visually. The color coding further emphasizes survival outcomes.

Age Distribution Plot 🎂👤

This histogram displays the distribution of passenger ages with a smooth KDE curve overlaid. The KDE curve helps identify peaks in age groups, highlighting the most common age ranges on board.

Bar Plot of Passenger Class (Pclass) 🛳️👑

Shows the distribution of passengers across different classes (1st, 2nd, and 3rd). Each bar corresponds to a class, helping you see the composition of passengers across socioeconomic categories.

Survival by Gender 🧑👩‍🦱💀

This plot compares survival counts by gender, providing insights into gender-related survival patterns. It's useful for assessing if one gender had a higher chance of survival.

Heatmap of Correlation Matrix 🔥🔗

This heatmap illustrates the correlation between various numeric features, helping identify relationships that may influence survival.

Fare Distribution Plot 💸📉

This histogram shows the distribution of ticket fares, with a KDE curve to emphasize patterns in ticket pricing. It's insightful for understanding fare ranges and their frequency.

Count Plot for Embarked Locations 🗺️⚓

This plot breaks down the number of passengers who boarded the Titanic from specific locations. Separate plots for each location (Q, S) show embarkation distribution, shedding light on passenger origins.

This structured visualization suite provides a thorough exploration of key factors impacting Titanic survival. Each plot contributes to a holistic view of passenger demographics, socioeconomic status, and survival likelihood.

        MOVIE RATING PREDICTION🎬 Movie Rating Prediction Project 📊

Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the rating of a movie based on various features such as genre, director, actors, duration, and votes. By analyzing historical movie data, we aim to estimate the ratings given to a movie by users or critics. 🏆

Project Steps:

Data Collection 📂
The project uses the IMDb Movies India dataset, which includes information like the movie name, genre, rating, year, duration, votes, and cast (directors and actors). The data was loaded using Pandas to perform various analysis and processing tasks.

Data Preprocessing 🧹

Missing Values: We removed or filled missing values in essential columns like genre, director, and rating to maintain the integrity of the dataset.
Categorical Variables: Label Encoding was used to convert categorical columns (like genre, director, and actors) into numeric values, making them compatible with machine learning models.
Duration Handling: The duration column, initially in a string format (e.g., "120 min"), was cleaned and converted into numeric values for model training.
Feature Engineering 🔧
Relevant features for predicting the movie rating were selected, including genre, director, actors, duration, and votes. These features were transformed into a format suitable for regression modeling.

Model Selection 🧠
We chose a Random Forest Regressor model to predict movie ratings, as it's a versatile model that works well for both regression and classification tasks.

Model Training 💻

The data was split into training and test sets using train_test_split. The training set was used to train the model, while the test set was used to evaluate the model's performance.
The model was trained on the selected features (X_train) and target variable (rating) (y_train).
Model Evaluation 📊
After training the model, we evaluated its performance using two key metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This provides a measure of how well the model fits the data and penalizes large errors more than MAE.
Model Tuning ⚙️
In this step, the model's hyperparameters were fine-tuned to optimize its performance, improving the prediction accuracy.

Prediction 🔮
Finally, the trained model was used to predict movie ratings for unseen data, helping to estimate ratings based on the movie's features.

Flowchart of the Process 🛠️

The project was visually represented in a flowchart, showing the step-by-step process of data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and prediction.

Insights & Results 💡

The model performance was evaluated, and the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) gave us a sense of how accurately the model could predict movie ratings.
The flowchart helped clarify the overall pipeline of building a movie rating prediction system, ensuring that each step is well-organized and effective.
📈 Conclusion:

This project provided insights into how data can be used to predict movie ratings, offering valuable information for content creators, movie enthusiasts, and critics. It demonstrates the power of machine learning in predicting outcomes based on historical data. 🤖💥
