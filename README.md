        MOVIE RATING PREDICTION🎬 Movie Rating Prediction Project 📊

Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the rating of a movie based on various features such as genre, director, actors, duration, and votes. By analyzing historical movie data, we aim to estimate the ratings given to a movie by users or critics. 🏆

Project Steps:

Data Collection 📂
The project uses the IMDb Movies India dataset, which includes information like the movie name, genre, rating, year, duration, votes, and cast (directors and actors). The data was loaded using Pandas to perform various analysis and processing tasks.

Data Preprocessing 🧹

Missing Values: We removed or filled missing values in essential columns like genre, director, and rating to maintain the integrity of the dataset.
Categorical Variables: Label Encoding was used to convert categorical columns (like genre, director, and actors) into numeric values, making them compatible with machine learning models.
Duration Handling: The duration column, initially in a string format (e.g., "120 min"), was cleaned and converted into numeric values for model training.
Feature Engineering 🔧
Relevant features for predicting the movie rating were selected, including genre, director, actors, duration, and votes. These features were transformed into a format suitable for regression modeling.

Model Selection 🧠
We chose a Random Forest Regressor model to predict movie ratings, as it's a versatile model that works well for both regression and classification tasks.

Model Training 💻

The data was split into training and test sets using train_test_split. The training set was used to train the model, while the test set was used to evaluate the model's performance.
The model was trained on the selected features (X_train) and target variable (rating) (y_train).
Model Evaluation 📊
After training the model, we evaluated its performance using two key metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This provides a measure of how well the model fits the data and penalizes large errors more than MAE.
Model Tuning ⚙️
In this step, the model's hyperparameters were fine-tuned to optimize its performance, improving the prediction accuracy.

Prediction 🔮
Finally, the trained model was used to predict movie ratings for unseen data, helping to estimate ratings based on the movie's features.

Flowchart of the Process 🛠️

The project was visually represented in a flowchart, showing the step-by-step process of data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and prediction.

Insights & Results 💡

The model performance was evaluated, and the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) gave us a sense of how accurately the model could predict movie ratings.
The flowchart helped clarify the overall pipeline of building a movie rating prediction system, ensuring that each step is well-organized and effective.
📈 Conclusion:

This project provided insights into how data can be used to predict movie ratings, offering valuable information for content creators, movie enthusiasts, and critics. It demonstrates the power of machine learning in predicting outcomes based on historical data. 🤖💥

                          IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

Steps Involved in the Iris Flower Classification Project 🌸📊
Load the Dataset 📥

The Iris dataset is loaded using sklearn.datasets.load_iris(). This dataset contains measurements for 150 flowers from three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica), including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Preprocess the Data 🔧

The data is organized into a pandas DataFrame, and the target labels (numerical values) are mapped to their corresponding species names using a dictionary (species_mapping).
Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets 🔄

The features (sepal and petal measurements) and the target variable (species) are separated.
The dataset is split into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%) using train_test_split() from sklearn.model_selection.
Train Different Machine Learning Models 📚

Several machine learning models are trained using the training data:
Decision Tree Classifier 🌳
Random Forest Classifier 🌲
Logistic Regression 🧑‍🏫
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 👥
Support Vector Machine (SVM) 💻
Evaluate Model Performance 📈

After training, each model is used to predict the species of flowers in the test set, and the accuracy of the predictions is calculated using accuracy_score().
Compare the Accuracy of Each Model 🔍

The accuracy of each model is printed to compare their performances. A bar chart is plotted using seaborn to visually compare how well each model performed.
Save the Best Model 💾

The model with the best accuracy (in this case, Random Forest) is selected and saved to a file using joblib.dump(). This allows the model to be loaded later for future use.
Visualize the Data with Scatter Plots 📉

The differences between the species are visually displayed by plotting scatter plots of:
Sepal Length vs Sepal Width 🌱
Petal Length vs Petal Width 🌸
The plots help show how the species can be distinguished based on these measurements.
Create a Flowchart of the Pipeline 🧑‍💻

            SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON

Loading and Preprocessing the Data 📂🔧
Loading the Dataset:
The first step is to load the advertising.csv dataset into a DataFrame using pandas. This allows us to work with the data in a structured way.
📝 Action: pd.read_csv('advertising.csv')

Handling Missing Values ❓:
The code checks for any missing values in the dataset using data.isnull().sum(). This helps identify if any data points are missing for any of the columns (TV, Radio, Newspaper, Sales). If there are any missing values, they can be handled through imputation or removal (though not done explicitly in the code).
🛠️ Action: data.isnull().sum()

Checking for Duplicates 🔄:
The next step is to check if there are any duplicate rows in the dataset. Duplicates are unnecessary and can skew the model’s predictions, so they are removed using data.drop_duplicates().
🧹 Action: data.duplicated().sum()

2. Data Visualization 📊🔍
Pairplot of Features and Target:
A pairplot is generated using seaborn to visualize the relationships between all the features (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and the target (Sales). This helps you understand if any linear patterns exist between features and sales, which is important for the model selection process.
📉 Action: sns.pairplot(data)

Scatterplots for Features vs Sales:
Scatterplots are created to specifically visualize the relationship between each feature (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and the target variable (Sales). This allows us to visually inspect the strength and direction of the relationships.
🎯 Action: sns.scatterplot(x='TV', y='Sales', data=data)

3. Splitting the Data 🔪📊
Feature Selection:
The independent variables (X) are selected to include 'TV', 'Radio', and 'Newspaper', which are the features used to predict sales. The dependent variable (y) is 'Sales', which is the target variable that the model is trying to predict.
🔑 Action: X = data[['TV', 'Radio', 'Newspaper']], y = data['Sales']

Training and Testing Split 🔄:
The dataset is split into a training set (80% of the data) and a testing set (20% of the data) using train_test_split(). This ensures that the model is trained on a portion of the data and tested on a separate portion, which helps evaluate its performance.
🏋️‍♀️ Action: train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

4. Model Training and Evaluation 🚀📉
Linear Regression Model:
The first model used is Linear Regression, a simple model that assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target. The model is trained on the training data (X_train, y_train). After training, predictions are made on the test data (X_test), and the performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
📐 Action: LinearRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)

Ridge and Lasso Regression:
These are variants of linear regression that include regularization to prevent overfitting:

Ridge Regression: Adds an L2 penalty to the loss function, which helps in controlling the magnitude of the coefficients.
Lasso Regression: Adds an L1 penalty, which can also set some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.
💡 Action: Ridge(alpha=1.0), Lasso(alpha=0.1)
These models are also trained and evaluated similarly to Linear Regression, and their MSE and R² scores are printed.

Random Forest Regression:
A more powerful model called Random Forest is trained, which builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions. This model tends to perform better for more complex data patterns than linear models. It also provides feature importance metrics.
🌲 Action: RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

5. Model Evaluation and Results 📊🎯
Model Performance:
After training the models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest), the predictions made on the test set are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²):

MSE quantifies the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values (lower is better).
R² tells us how well the model explains the variability of the target variable (closer to 1 is better). 📈 Action: mean_squared_error(), r2_score()
Comparison of Models:
The results from Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest are printed, allowing you to compare which model performs the best in terms of MSE and R².
🥇 Action: print(f'Ridge MSE: {mse_ridge}, R2: {r2_ridge}'), print(f'Lasso MSE: {mse_lasso}, R2: {r2_lasso}')

6. Visualizing Results 📈🌟
Feature Importance:
For the Random Forest model, it's often useful to visualize which features have the most impact on the target variable (Sales). Random Forest can compute feature importance, and we can plot this to understand how each feature contributes to the model.
🔍 Action: rf_model.feature_importances_

Scatter Plots for Features:
Scatterplots are again used to visually assess the relationship between the features (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and the target variable (Sales). This provides insights into whether linear regression assumptions hold or if more complex models are required.
🎨 Action: sns.scatterplot(x='TV', y='Sales', data=data)

In Summary 💡🔍:
The dataset is first loaded and cleaned by removing duplicates and checking for missing values.
We visualize the data using pairplots and scatterplots to understand feature-target relationships.
The data is split into training and testing sets, and multiple models are applied to predict sales: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
After training, models are evaluated using MSE and R², and their performance is compared.
Visualizations are generated to analyze the relationships between features and target sales.
This workflow provides a comprehensive approach to predicting sales using machine learning, and the use of different models helps you understand which performs best for your dataset.
