        MOVIE RATING PREDICTION🎬 Movie Rating Prediction Project 📊

Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the rating of a movie based on various features such as genre, director, actors, duration, and votes. By analyzing historical movie data, we aim to estimate the ratings given to a movie by users or critics. 🏆

Project Steps:

Data Collection 📂
The project uses the IMDb Movies India dataset, which includes information like the movie name, genre, rating, year, duration, votes, and cast (directors and actors). The data was loaded using Pandas to perform various analysis and processing tasks.

Data Preprocessing 🧹

Missing Values: We removed or filled missing values in essential columns like genre, director, and rating to maintain the integrity of the dataset.
Categorical Variables: Label Encoding was used to convert categorical columns (like genre, director, and actors) into numeric values, making them compatible with machine learning models.
Duration Handling: The duration column, initially in a string format (e.g., "120 min"), was cleaned and converted into numeric values for model training.
Feature Engineering 🔧
Relevant features for predicting the movie rating were selected, including genre, director, actors, duration, and votes. These features were transformed into a format suitable for regression modeling.

Model Selection 🧠
We chose a Random Forest Regressor model to predict movie ratings, as it's a versatile model that works well for both regression and classification tasks.

Model Training 💻

The data was split into training and test sets using train_test_split. The training set was used to train the model, while the test set was used to evaluate the model's performance.
The model was trained on the selected features (X_train) and target variable (rating) (y_train).
Model Evaluation 📊
After training the model, we evaluated its performance using two key metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This provides a measure of how well the model fits the data and penalizes large errors more than MAE.
Model Tuning ⚙️
In this step, the model's hyperparameters were fine-tuned to optimize its performance, improving the prediction accuracy.

Prediction 🔮
Finally, the trained model was used to predict movie ratings for unseen data, helping to estimate ratings based on the movie's features.

Flowchart of the Process 🛠️

The project was visually represented in a flowchart, showing the step-by-step process of data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and prediction.

Insights & Results 💡

The model performance was evaluated, and the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) gave us a sense of how accurately the model could predict movie ratings.
The flowchart helped clarify the overall pipeline of building a movie rating prediction system, ensuring that each step is well-organized and effective.
📈 Conclusion:

This project provided insights into how data can be used to predict movie ratings, offering valuable information for content creators, movie enthusiasts, and critics. It demonstrates the power of machine learning in predicting outcomes based on historical data. 🤖💥

                          IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

Steps Involved in the Iris Flower Classification Project 🌸📊
Load the Dataset 📥

The Iris dataset is loaded using sklearn.datasets.load_iris(). This dataset contains measurements for 150 flowers from three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica), including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Preprocess the Data 🔧

The data is organized into a pandas DataFrame, and the target labels (numerical values) are mapped to their corresponding species names using a dictionary (species_mapping).
Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets 🔄

The features (sepal and petal measurements) and the target variable (species) are separated.
The dataset is split into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%) using train_test_split() from sklearn.model_selection.
Train Different Machine Learning Models 📚

Several machine learning models are trained using the training data:
Decision Tree Classifier 🌳
Random Forest Classifier 🌲
Logistic Regression 🧑‍🏫
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 👥
Support Vector Machine (SVM) 💻
Evaluate Model Performance 📈

After training, each model is used to predict the species of flowers in the test set, and the accuracy of the predictions is calculated using accuracy_score().
Compare the Accuracy of Each Model 🔍

The accuracy of each model is printed to compare their performances. A bar chart is plotted using seaborn to visually compare how well each model performed.
Save the Best Model 💾

The model with the best accuracy (in this case, Random Forest) is selected and saved to a file using joblib.dump(). This allows the model to be loaded later for future use.
Visualize the Data with Scatter Plots 📉

The differences between the species are visually displayed by plotting scatter plots of:
Sepal Length vs Sepal Width 🌱
Petal Length vs Petal Width 🌸
The plots help show how the species can be distinguished based on these measurements.
Create a Flowchart of the Pipeline 🧑‍💻

A flowchart is created using networkx to visualize the steps involved in the entire classification process, from loading the data to saving the best model.
